## Hi ^^
I'm Florian, but some call me Java (for legacy reasons).
I come from Germany and am into systems engineering ~~and apparantly and slowly working my self into backend development.~~ and apparantly also programming language development now, thats new.

 [![GitHub Streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com?user=JavaDerg&theme=shades-of-purple&date_format=M%20j%5B%2C%20Y%5D)](https://git.io/streak-stats) 

### Potentially interesting projects:
(Please take note that sadly not all of my projects have a readme, I appoligize deeply about that)

#### Current Projects:
##### WickerBeast Project
- [Wicker](https://github.com/JavaDerg/wicker): A Wasm based Microkernel I am building with a friend @AwesomeQubic.
- - [WickerTime](https://github.com/JavaDerg/wickertime): Originally a wasmtime fork, now a mostly diy Wasm compiler/embedded because it turns out wasmtime dropped no_std a while ago.
- - [Rust](https://github.com/JavaDerg/rust): Amazing, just a fork of rust, sadly was nececary to bring std into kernel space. :>


#### Actually finished and usable :)
- [Mc-Router](https://github.com/JavaDerg/mc-router): A minecraft reverse proxy for hosting multible servers on one port.
- [lighthouse-2.0-signals](https://github.com/JavaDerg/lighthouse-2.0-signals) A tool that lets you explode some of the Valve Indexes (VR Headsets) basestation 2.0 signals, this was mostly a toy for me to understand the data and decode it.
- [Mist](https://github.com/JavaDerg/mist) A wierd programming language that follows strict reverse polish notation and somehow works. (CW: the syntax is way worse then brainfuck :D)

#### Half way there, maybe I'll finish them in the future
- [wassup](https://github.com/JavaDerg/wassup) A plugin framework for rust applications based on webassembly work custom async runtime, context switching and hopefully a plugin api at some point.
- [bolt](https://github.com/JavaDerg/bolt) A general purpose web server similar to nginx developed in rust.
- [sdf](https://github.com/JavaDerg/sdf) A cpu based renderer for 3D signed distance fields, works-ish light is glitched.
- [doit](https://github.com/JavaDerg/doit) A "lightweight" (feature wise) sudo alternative written in rust that fails to hide your password when typing it in.
